        <article class="main">
            <p>Amalia is a responsible middle school student. Her dog, Spot, is a cute little dog with a big black spot right on his back. When Amalia got home from school this afternoon, she let Spot out in the fenced-in backyard. Because it was a beautiful day, she decided to leave him in the yard while she went out to babysit two elementary school neighborhood kids. Spot was used to laying in the sun in the backyard alone, so Amalia didn't worry about him being in the backyard alone. But when Amalia got back from babysitting two hours later -- SPOT WAS GONE! There wasn't a hole dug under the fence, the gate wasn't open, her parents hadn't gotten home from work yet to let him in...so where did he go?</p>

            <p>Put on your detective hat and solve the following clues to find Spot.</p>
