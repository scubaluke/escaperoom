            As Amalia races around the backyard looking for clues as to where Spot went, she feels her body getting warm. She knows she is feeling an emotion, but it is hard to pinpoint exactly what she's feeling. People can feel more than one emotion at one time and we can feel more complex emotions, especially as we get older. When we feel complex emotions, we may feel confused as to exactly what we are feeling. We might feel a bit sad and angry, which perhaps turns into disgust. Or we might feel anticipation because of a surprise that is coming to us from someone we trust, which perhaps turns into joy). </p>

        <p>To Amalia, her feelings about Spot going missing isn't terror -- she's pretty sure Spot is safe somewhere. She just doesn't know where. But she also doesn't feel only apprehension -- her emotion is stronger than that.</p>

<p>Look at the picture below of complex emotions to answer the question about Amalia below.</p>
